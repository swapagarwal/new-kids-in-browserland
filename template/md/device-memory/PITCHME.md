Note:

- Enable developers to tailor content at runtime in accordance with hardware limitations. For example, developers can serve a "lite" app to users on low-end devices, resulting in better experiences and fewer frustrations.
- Add context to metrics, such as the amount of time a task takes to complete in JavaScript, through the lens of device memory. This will result in a better understanding of how device memory correlates with user behavior, conversions, or other metrics important to your business.
