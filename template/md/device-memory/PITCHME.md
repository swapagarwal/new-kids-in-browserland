### Device Memory API

(Tailor content dynamically based on device memory!)

This API returns the amount of device memory (RAM) on a user's machine in gigabytes.

---

### Use Cases

- Enable developers to tailor content at runtime in accordance with hardware limitations. For example, developers can serve a "lite" app to users on low-end devices, resulting in better experiences and fewer frustrations.

---

### Use Cases (Continued)

- Add context to metrics, such as the amount of time a task takes to complete in JavaScript, through the lens of device memory. This will result in a better understanding of how device memory correlates with user behavior, conversions, or other metrics important to your business.
