Note:
My name is Swapnil and I'm a software engineer at Meesho. Prior to that, I worked for 2 years at Amazon. At night, I use my projects to lower the entry barrier in the world of open-source. If you're passionate about open-source sustainability or helping people start their open-source journey in general, you should definitely contact me via social media. I go by the handle swapagarwal.
