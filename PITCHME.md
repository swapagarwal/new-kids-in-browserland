## Recap

@ul
- A modern solution to handle scroll events (Intersection Observer API)
- Keep login simple for your users (Credential Management API)
- Make your website network-responsive (Network Information API)
@ulend

## Recap

@ul
- Sharing made ridiculously easy (Web Share API)
- Tailor content dynamically based on device memory (Device Memory API)
- Buy seamlessly on the web (Payment Request API)
@ulend

Note:
I'd like to add that all of these APIs can be used progressively, i.e. you can integrate them in your websites in such a way that users who are on supported browsers can be upgraded to a new experience while those who are still on unsupported browsers will remain on your old flow.
On that note, I'd just like to emphasize one last thing. Always develop features keeping your users in mind and not just for the sake of it.
That's all I have for today. Thank you for your time!
